      <p>So basically matriculation data is acting weird, but the rest
        of the stuff I took is just from the same site. Let me know what you want
        me to add and from what site and I can! This is just the layout.
        Also I'm changing the text size so don't worry on that.

        Bonus! - Wait for 10 seconds and the paywall will disapear!
